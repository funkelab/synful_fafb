# Automatic Detection of Synaptic Partners in a Whole-Brain Drosophila EM Dataset

This repository serves as an entry point for accessing and interacting with
predicted synaptic partners in the full adult fly brain (FAFB) dataset.

Details about the method can be found in our [bioRxiv preprint](biorxiv link).

If you are interested in

- using predicted synapses for circuit reconstruction in CATMAID, see the

  and this [example jupyter notebook](XXX) on how to use it

- using our evaluation data to compare your own synapse prediction method, stay tuned for our data release (end of December 2019)!

- training and/or predicting on your own data, stay tuned for our source code release (end of December 2019)!
