Synful_FAFB
===========

## Overview

Synful: A project for the automated detection of synaptic partners in Electron Microscopy brain data using U-Nets.

This repos serves as an entry point for accessing and interacting with predicted synaptic partners in the fly brain (FAFB) dataset.
If you are interested

- in training and/or predicting on your own data, find scripts here: https://github.com/funkelab/synful

- using large-scale ground-truth synapse data to evaluate your own method on FAFB, see this [section](Evaluation-on-large-scale-dataset).

- downloading all 244 Million predicted synaptic connections in FAFB, see XXX

- using predicted synapses in your circuit reconstruction workflow inside CATMAID: http://github.com/unidesigner/circuitmap


For more details, see the following publication:

Note, that this repos is work-in-progress. Please don't hesitate to create an issue or write us an email if something is unclear.

## Synaptic Connections in FAFB

We used the synful method based on an U-Net to predict 244 Million putative synaptic partners in the full adult fly brain (FAFB) dataset.

Synapses will soon be available for browsing in neuroglancer.


## Evaluation on large-scale dataset

Data and evaluation scripts will be available soon.
