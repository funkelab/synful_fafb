# Automatic Detection of Synaptic Partners in a Whole-Brain Drosophila EM Dataset

This repository serves as an entry point for accessing and interacting with
predicted synaptic partners in the full adult fly brain (FAFB) dataset.

Details about the method can be found in our [bioRxiv preprint](biorxiv link).

If you are interested in

- using predicted synapses for circuit reconstruction in CATMAID, see the
  [CircuitMap](http://github.com/unidesigner/circuitmap) application

- downloading all 244 million predicted synaptic connections in FAFB, see [this
  SQL dump](https://cremi.org/static/data/20191211_fafbv14_buhmann2019_li20190805.db)
  and this [example jupyter notebook](XXX) on how to use it

- using our evaluation data to compare your own synapse prediction method, see
  this [section](#evaluation-on-large-scale-dataset).

- training and/or predicting on your own data, find our scripts

## Evaluation on large-scale dataset

Data and evaluation scripts will be available soon!
