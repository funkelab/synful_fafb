Synful_FAFB
===========
Overview
--------

Synful: A project for the automated detection of synaptic partners in Electron Microscopy brain data using U-Nets.

This repos serves as an entry point for accessing and interacting with predicted synaptic partners in the FAFB dataset.
If you are interested

- in training and/or predicting on your own data, find scripts here: https://github.com/funkelab/synful

- using large-scale ground-truth synapse data to evaluate your own method on FAFB, see XXX.

- downloading all 244 Million predicted synaptic connections in FAFB, see XXX

- using predicted synapses in your circuit reconstruction workflow inside CATMAID: http://github.com/unidesigner/circuitmap
